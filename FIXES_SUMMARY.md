# CV Generator App - Bug Fixes and Improvements

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical UI Crash - IllegalArgumentException
**Problem:** App was crashing with error: `minLines 2 must be less than or equal to maxLines 1`

**Root Cause:** In `DataInputScreen.kt`, the `ModernTextField` function had a bug where `minLines` could be set to 2 but `maxLines` defaulted to 1, violating Compose's validation rules.

**Solution:**
- Modified `ModernTextField` to ensure `maxLines` is always >= `minLines`
- Added safety check: `val safeMaxLines = if (maxLines < minLines) minLines else maxLines`
- Changed default `maxLines` from 1 to `Int.MAX_VALUE` for better flexibility

### 2. PDF Upload Not Working
**Problem:** Users getting "Unsupported file format - only text files supported currently" when uploading PDFs

**Root Cause:** PDF parsing libraries were commented out in `build.gradle` and `FileParsingService.kt` only supported text files.

**Solution:**
- Added PDF parsing dependencies: `itext7-core:7.2.5`
- Added DOC/DOCX parsing: Apache POI libraries
- Implemented `parsePDF()`, `parseDOCX()`, and `parseDOC()` methods
- Enhanced file type detection using both MIME types and file extensions

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### 1. Enhanced DataInputScreen Design
- **Modern Material 3 Design:** Updated with contemporary UI patterns

- **Enhanced File Upload UI:** 
  - Larger, more prominent upload button with gradient icon
